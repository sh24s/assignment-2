# AI Usage Reportâ€” Assignment 2:
Tools Used & Use Cases

ChatGPT (AI assistant):
- Suggested HTML/CSS/JS structure for portfolio.
- Helped with adding interactivity (coin sound, block reveal animations).
- Guided creation of dynamic project filtering and theme toggle features.
- Assisted in drafting README.md and technical documentation.

# Benefits & Challenges:-
# Benefits:
- Saved development time.
- Gave creative ideas for retro design.
- Helped debug small CSS/JS issues (syntax errors, missing file paths, or logic mistakes).

# Challenges:
- Some suggestions required manual corrections (e.g., file paths, syntax).
- AI sometimes gave overly complex solutions when a simpler one worked better.

# Learning Outcomes:
- Improved understanding of JavaScript DOM events.
- Learned how to handle LocalStorage for saving user preferences (theme, username, skills).
- Learned how to structure a portfolio project with assets (images, sounds, CSS, JS).
- Gained practice in adapting AI suggestions into a personal coding style.

# Responsible Modifications:
- Verified and tested all AI-generated code before using it.
- Simplified AI suggestions where needed to keep the project lightweight.
- Customized design and wording to reflect personal style, not just AI outputs.
- Used AI as a learning and productivity tool, not a replacement for personal understanding.

**Summary:**  
AI tools were used responsibly and effectively to enhance the quality and interactivity of the portfolio while ensuring full understanding of every part of the codebase.
